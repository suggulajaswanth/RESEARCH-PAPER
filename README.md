RESOURCE AWARE PLACEMENT OF IOT APPLICATION MODULES IN FOG COMPUTING



# ABOUT THIS PAPER:
In this paper, I defined the efficiency differences between the current cloud algorithms, Edgeward algorithm and Genetic algorithm. As opposed to Cloud-only and Edgeward placement algorithms, I discovered that the “Genetic algorithm” produces more efficient and optimal performance. I demonstrated the effectiveness of the new fog computing model in addressing the most challenging challenges, such as energy usage, latency, and finishing work on schedule for time-sensitive operations, all of which are critical for IoT applications.
I tested different examples, such as camera networks; with both existing algorithms and the Genetic algorithms ,I am developing to demonstrate that they are more efficient than the current algorithms. I've provided a comparative comparison based on latency, energy use, and network use.
Based on the results of the preceding case studies, I infer that the Genetic model influences the outcomes of IoT applications. It was designed with many use cases in mind, and it can be applied to a wide range of Iot devices.
